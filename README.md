## ⚙️ Requirements

- Flutter: the latest version on `flutter beta channel`
- Dart: 2.9.0+
- Xcode: 11.5.0+
- Androind Studio 4.0.0+
- Ruby: 2.6.0+

## 🎉 Develop

Run you app in Chrome

```sh
flutter run -d chrome
```

To hot restart (and rebuild state), press "R".

## 👷‍♂️Building with the production JavaScript compiler

To enable the release compiler, run.

```sh
flutter build web && cp -R build/web docs
```

This will create a `build/web` directory with index.html, main.dart.js and the rest of the files needed to run
the application using a static HTTP server.

## 🤷‍♀️ Support

Post issues and feature requests on the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/minikin/flutter-web-demo/issues).

## ⛑Troubleshooting

In case of some errors try to run:

```sh
flutter clean
```

If you catch an error like this:

```sh
flutter packages pub global run webdev serve -r
webdev could not run for this project.
Could not find a file named "pubspec.yaml" in "/Users/JohnDoe/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/built_value-6.7.1".
pub finished with exit code 78
```

try to run:

```sh
pub cache repair
```

This project use `built_value` and `built_collection` as dependencies so you might need to run command below before to start a web server:

```sh
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
